# Benefits
Using a test runner like Vitest has many benefits.
In this section we will explore some of them.

## Safety
Testing is a way to ensure that your code does what you expect it to do.
This is especially important for code that is critical to your
application, or if multiple people are working on the same codebase.

## Confidence
When you have a good test suite, you can be confident that your code
works as expected. This allows you to make changes to your codebase
without worrying about breaking things.

## Documentation
Tests are a form of documentation. They show how your code is supposed
to be used, and what it is supposed to do. This is especially true for
unit tests, which test a single function or component in isolation.

## Refactoring
When you have a good test suite, you can refactor your code with
confidence. If you break something, your tests will tell you.

## Regression
With good test coverage you can be confident that you will not
introduce regressions when you make changes to your codebase.

## Gamification
Writing tests can be fun! If you write your tests first, you can
think of it as a game. You write a test, and then you try to make it
pass. This is called
[Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development).
